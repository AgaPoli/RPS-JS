# Rock Paper Scissors Game in the JavaScript

Created a rock, paper and scissors game with two players. The game consists of 3 possible choices.


## Rock Paper Scissors?

Never played Rock Paper Scissors before? No problem! It's easy! Throw rock, paper, or scissors at the same time as your opponent. Rock crushes scissors; paper covers rock; scissors cuts paper. Easy, right? Sure! But, can you devise a STRATEGY to beat another human player over and over again? Strategy? Really? Yes, really! Throw rock every time and your opponent will obviously notice your oh-so-sly pattern and destroy you. You'll just pick one at random? There is no such thing as "random"! Your opponent will figure out what your SUBCONSCIOUS is up to and will soundly defeat you.
